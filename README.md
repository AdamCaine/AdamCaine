- 👋 Hi, I’m @AdamCaine
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to say I want to be the best without sounding like an anime character.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python through YouTube and taking HTML, CSS, Javascript for Web Developers through Coursera.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on helping me reach a skill where I can start collaborating on stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me I'll get back to you on that.
